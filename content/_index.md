## About Me

Hello! I'm Kian Musser! I'm a freelance technical writer and self-taught programmer who loves building things with computers. I love helping others understand technology and how cool it is!

When I was a kid, I'd take computers apart and try to put them back together. Now, I love building websites with ReactJS (it's like building with Legos).
