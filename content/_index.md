## About Me

Hello! I'm Kian Musser! I'm a freelance technical writer and self-taught programmer who loves building things with computers.

Throughout my years of experience with computers, I've learned a lot, but more importantly, I've learned how to learn quickly and developed a broad background of technological experience.

I currently specialize in writing tutorials and "how to's" for beginner developers. I can help your business by writing tutorials that engage readers and help your content marketing efforts!
